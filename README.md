# BMI Prediction using Image Classification


A simple AI project to predict a personâ€™s Body Mass Index (BMI) based on images. This project was made for our AI course in university to practice image preprocessing, dataset handling, and training.

## How to run

1. Download or clone this repo.  
2. Extract the `TrainingData_Images.zip`.  
3. Install needed Python packages (e.g. `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `opencv`, etc.).  
4. Run the preprocessing script, then train the model with the processed images.  
5. Evaluate the model results (RMSE, accuracy, etc.) and tweak parameters.

## Limitations & Future Work

- The model is still basic and may not work well for all kinds of images or lighting / angles.  
- Accuracy needs improvement, more diverse dataset, better preprocessing, maybe data augmentation.
